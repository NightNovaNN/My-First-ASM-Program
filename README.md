# My-First-ASM-Program
My first ASM program

## Details
This code is for `NASM` on `Windows` and architecture type is `x86-64`

## Compile
Use NASM and do:
```sh
nasm -f win64 first.asm -o first.obj
# Link
gcc first.obj -o first
# Run
./first
```

## Note
This won't do anything and it's just a repo to track my progress, though i'll use this code for my future project!
